IASA 2.0 Working Group - Minutes of Decisions Minute taker: Eric Rescorla


Board Size and Structure
Joe Hall presents two options (See slide 3)
1. Always 7 directors, Two self-appointed from the LLC
2. At least 7 directors, maximum 9 with 2 LLC-optional appointees

Discussion at the microphone. Not transcribing it.

Hums.
Should the target number of board members be 5 or 7?
Some support for 5, more for 7, almost none for 9

Can anyone not live with 7?
Very few people

Can anyone not live with 5?
Maybe a little more than can’t live with 7.

Consensus for: Target number of 7, minimum operating number of 5.

Option 2 vs. Option 3

Option 2 (5 directors, expandable to 6 or 7)
● 1 IETF Chair or delegate selected by the IESG
● 1 Appointed by the ISOC Board of Trustees
● 3 Appointed by the IETF NomCom, confirmed by the IESG
● AS NEEDED, UP TO 2 Appointed by the LLC board itself, confirmed by the IESG

Option 3 (7 Directors)
● 1 IETF Chair or delegate selected by the IESG
● 1 Appointed by the ISOC Board of Trustees
● 3 Appointed by the IETF NomCom, confirmed by the IESG
● 2 Appointed by the LLC board itself, confirmed by the IESG

Hum: Solid consensus for Option 2.

Action: Co-chairs will send to mailing list with a final 2-week validation of consensus

Can anyone not live with option 2?
Silence.

IETF Trust
General sense that a minimal-sized trust was reasonable. No hums
